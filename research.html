  <h2>My Research</h2>
  <h3>Injection Lock Stabilizer with Arduino</h3>
  <p>Abstract: This device is capable of stabilizing a standard laser injection lock indefinitely. It is easy to build and use,
and it requires minimal power supply and computing power to run.<br>
  This project was completed during my time in John Doyle's experimental AMO group at Harvard in 2021. A complete description of how the device works and how to build the software and hardware can be viewed <a href="Injection_lock_Stabiliser.pdf">here</a>.</p>
  <h3>Superradiance-assisted two-color Doppler cooling of molecules</h3>
  <p>Abstract: For experiments that require a quantum system to be in the ultra-cold regime, laser cooling isan essential tool. While techniques for laser cooling ions and neutral atoms have been refined andtemperatures below the Doppler limit have been achieved, present-day techniques are limited toa small class of molecules. This paper proposes a general cooling scheme for molecules based onvibrational-state transitions. Superradiance is used to speed up the two-photon transition. Sim-ulations of this scheme achieve temperatures comparable to those achieved by existing two-levelschemes for neutral atoms and ions.<br>
  This project was completed in Susanne Yelin's Theory AMO group at Harvard. In 2021 we co-wrote a paper on the results, which can be found on arXiv <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.00912">here</a>. A version of this paper is also pending publication in Phys Rev A.</p>
